Minutes after our friendly customer care team sets up your account and trains you online, you'll be ready to organize, send and update manuals to every pilot in your fleet.
Designed with both single-aircraft operators and large fleets in mind, Aviation Docs is the best way to send aircraft manuals, flight plans, forms, checklists, training manuals, ICAO annexes, insurance certificates, medical certificates, MELs, charts, NOTAMS, regulation changes, rescue and firefighting procedures, SMS docs, weather information, dangerous goods procedures... virtually every doc your pilots need, securely, reliably and compliantly.
Ensure your pilots have actually received each document.
The only way to know your pilots have the correct document on their iPad, is to use Aviation Docs. Patched together systems that transfer a file to an iPad are worthless if the operator isn't 100% certain that the pilot has received the file. Aviation Docs shows your fleet manager and dispatcher "at a glance" whether everybody in your organization has received any updated library or document set. 
Want proof of reception AND authentication? Pilots can sign any document and send you back a signed copy. 
The 7 top reasons both fleets and single aircraft operations choose Aviation Docs
CONTINUOUS AUDIT DASHBOARD: View the up-to the-second Fleet Status Dashboard that proves to you and your POI (should you ever need it) who got the document and when, as well as critical information about the mobile device health and version compliance of all your devices.
DRAG, DROP... AND APPROVE: Our drag and drop console allows you to preview and then approve what's sent to your pilots so you make fewer errors and improve safety.
ZERO EFFORT FLIGHT PLAN DELIVERY AND MONITORING: Deliver and monitor flight plan delivery to pilots 100% automatically from most popular flight planning services.
NO MORE COURIER COSTS: Reduce courier cost by sending all documents electronically. Many operators use ultra-fast scanners like the $500 Fujitsu Scansnap to convert any paper to a searchable PDF file and drop into Aviation Docs.
DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT: Make sure your documents are protected from theft or copyright infringement using our proprietary DRM system. In 30 seconds you can right-protect any document or folder with your own "shrink-wrap" legal notice and disclaimer.
HIGH PERFORMANCE: Upload and download documents in our proprietary siloed cloud storage with transfer speeds up to 2Gbps. Designed specifically for aviation, you'll have good performance no matter what part of the world you're in.
INDUSTRY STANDARD: Join thousands of pilots, test pilots and aircraft manufacturers in business and commercial fleets who rely on Aviation Docs, every hour of the day.
